Ensure the letter adheres to the following format:

1. **Introduction**: A brief and enthusiastic introduction expressing interest in the role and organization.
2. **Body**: Highlight relevant skills, experiences, and achievements that align with the job description. Use specific examples when possible.
3. **Closing**: Reiterate enthusiasm for the role, express willingness to contribute to the organization, and include a polite call to action.
